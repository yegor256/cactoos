 * Output.
 *
 * <p>Here is for example how {@link Output} can be used
 * together with {@link Input} in order to modify the content
 * of a text file:</p>
 *
 * <pre> new LengthOf(
 *   new TeeInput(
 *     new InputOf(new TextOf("Hello, world!")),
 *     new OutputTo(new File("/tmp/names.txt"))
 *   )
 * ).asValue();</pre>
 *
 * <p>Here {@link OutputTo} implements {@link Output} and behaves like
 * one, providing write-only access to the encapsulated
 * {@link java.io.File}. The {@link TeeInput} copies the content of the
 * input to the output. The {@link org.cactoos.io.LengthOf}
 * calculates the size of the copied data.</p>
 *
 * <p>There is no thread-safety guarantee.
